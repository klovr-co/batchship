# shiplane

shiplane: every agent PR in its own lane, landed in order and tracked to live. You only step in when a decision is yours.

An agent works in its own worktree, a pre-push gate runs the cheap checks on its machine, and `shiplane <pr>` hands the
PR to a Mergify merge queue that tests queued PRs together in one CI run (ordinary PRs run no CI). shiplane then stays
with the PR (it queues it again after a push) until it is merged and deployed, and prints one line: the merged sha, the
deploy status and the live URL, or what failed and the one next step. A short block in AGENTS.md tells agents the rules;
`.agents/config.yml` holds the settings. Node ESM, zero dependencies, MIT.

Nobody has to ask "status?" or "is it live?" (1.1): GitHub comments on each PR when it deploys (or fails, or every
deploy job was skipped), assigns `needs-owner` PRs to the owners, and opens one "Live branch is red" issue; agents run
`shiplane <pr> --background` and are woken when it exits; and `shiplane guard`, a turn-end hook, keeps an agent from ending a
turn with a queued PR nobody follows or a question no `needs-owner` PR or issue carries.

No install needed for everyday use (1.1.1): `shiplane init` commits the runtime into `.agents/shiplane/`, so anyone who clones
a shiplane repo ships with `node .agents/shiplane/shiplane.mjs <pr> --background` and gets the turn-end guard from the repo's
own `.claude/settings.json` and `.codex/hooks.json`. shiplane itself is needed only for `init`, `doctor`, `setup` and `upkeep`.

shiplane was named tug until 1.1.1 (and batchship before that); see [From tug](#from-tug).

## Install

    git clone https://github.com/klovr-co/shiplane && cd shiplane && npm link    # puts `shiplane` on PATH

Only whoever runs `shiplane init`, `doctor`, `setup` or `upkeep` needs it. As an agent plugin (for the `adopt` and `ship`
skills): Claude Code `/plugin marketplace add klovr-co/shiplane` then `/plugin install shiplane@shiplane`; Codex
`codex plugin marketplace add klovr-co/shiplane` then `codex plugin add shiplane@shiplane`.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `shiplane init [--dry-run] [--force]` | Once per repo, and again after a shiplane update. Reads the ship branch from origin and opens **one PR** (labelled `needs-owner`) with `.agents/config.yml` (missing keys added, yours kept; a new one guesses `mergeMethod` from the repo's `.mergify.yml` and `deployWorkflows` from workflows named deploy/release that run on a push to the ship branch, and leaves `liveUrl` empty with a note), the AGENTS.md block (only between `<!-- shiplane:start vX -->` and `<!-- shiplane:end -->`; hand-written `##` sections it supersedes, by heading in `supersededSections`, are removed and listed), the runtime in `.agents/shiplane/` (the gate, `shiplane.mjs` for `ship` and `guard`), the guard as project-level Stop hooks (`.claude/settings.json`, `.codex/hooks.json`, merged into the repo's files), the pre-push hook (merged into the repo's lefthook `pre-push:` section or appended to `.husky/pre-push`; else `.githooks/pre-push`, which runs a repo's own hook first, kept as `.githooks/pre-push.repo`), `.mergify.yml` and `.agents/shiplane.lock` (kit version and the runtime's hashes). Every file it writes is checked with `git check-ignore`: a directory rule like `.agents/` becomes `.agents/*` with `!` exceptions, any other rule makes it stop with the rule named. Before each push it runs `installCommand` in its scratch worktree, so the repo's own pre-push gate can run; a push that still fails is reported with the reason and the work kept, and the second PR is still made. Creates the labels `queue`, `hotfix`, `hold`, `needs-owner`, `approved`, `full-ci`, and sets the default branch to `branches[shipTarget]` (Mergify reads its config there). Also adds `.agents/state/` to `.gitignore`, and opens a **second PR** (also `needs-owner`, since it changes `.github/`) with `.github/workflows/shiplane-events.yml`, rendered from the config (see Events). Keeps a repo's own `.mergify.yml` or hook and says what to change; `--force` replaces them. `--dry-run` prints the plan. |
| `shiplane setup` | Optional, once per machine per repo. Turns the gate on: `core.hooksPath .githooks` when there is no hook manager; with lefthook or husky it never sets it, and unsets a stale `.githooks` that would switch them off. Adds `gh needs-me` (open PRs and issues labelled needs-owner or hold: `gh search issues --owner <org> --state open label:needs-owner,hold --include-prs`), registers the repo in `~/.config/shiplane/repos`, checks gh auth, node and the package manager against the repo's pin, and prints the T3 settings to apply (worktree per thread; a setup script that installs dependencies, e.g. `bunx bun@$(cat .bun-version) install --frozen-lockfile`). Installs the turn-end guard as a user-level Stop hook for each harness it finds (`~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.codex/hooks.json`; `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`/`CODEX_HOME` respected), merging into the file and reading it back; existing hooks are kept. A harness whose hook the repo already commits (project-level) gets none; if both exist, the guard runs once per stop (it dedupes on the session and the event, under a lock). |
| `shiplane <pr> [--now] [--background]` · `shiplane <pr> --status` (the default command is ship: `shiplane ship <pr>` is the same; with no install, `node .agents/shiplane/shiplane.mjs <pr> ...`) | Refuses `needs-owner` and `hold`, and a PR whose changed files match `needsOwner.paths` unless it has `approved` (checked again after every push). Checks `deployWorkflows` against `.github/workflows/` first. Marks a draft ready, adds `queue` (and `hotfix` with `--now`, refused if another open PR has it), posts a comment that is exactly `@mergifyio queue` (the label alone does not queue), polls the Mergify check until queued, re-posts after a push only once Mergify has registered it, waits for the merge, then for `deployWorkflows` on the merge commit. On 2, 3 and 5 it removes `queue`/`hotfix` and posts `@mergifyio dequeue` if it was queued. Waits out GitHub rate limits (at most 15 min at a time). A deploy whose jobs were all skipped by path filters is reported as such, not as deployed. Exit 0 merged and deployed · 2 refused · 3 out of the queue · 4 deploy failed · 5 timed out · 1 error. Every run keeps its progress, a heartbeat and its result in `.agents/state/ship-<pr>.json` and records the PR for the agent's session (`SHIPLANE_SESSION_ID`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` or `CODEX_THREAD_ID`). `--background` prints nothing until the end, then one line (`<result> · next: <step>`): start it in a background shell and you are woken when it exits. `--status` prints the last state without waiting. One run per PR (`ship-<pr>.lock`): a second exits 2 with "already shipping" while the first is alive and beating. |
| `shiplane doctor` | Reports, changes nothing: labels, default branch = ship branch, the pre-push hook really runs here (and through which mechanism; for `.githooks`, whether `core.hooksPath` is set), AGENTS block and lock versions = kit version, the runtime in `.agents/shiplane/` = this kit's (another version's or hand-edited files are named), every shiplane file is tracked by git (an ignore rule that kept one out is named), every queue rule blocks `hold` and `needs-owner`, the events workflow matches the config, `owners` is set, the guard hook is installed (project-level first, else user-level) in each harness and fires (a probe run), root checkout behind origin, and tug leftovers (files, hooks, plugin or registry from before the rename). |
| `shiplane guard [--hook claude\|codex]` | The turn-end check. Blocks when (a) a PR this session queued is neither merged and deployed nor followed by a live `shiplane <pr>` run (pid and heartbeat in its state file; once per session per PR, and not when GitHub says it is closed or merged), (b) the session waits on an open queued PR with only a PR watch (T3's `watch_pull_request`, read from the transcript; the watch ends at merge without waking the agent), every turn until a `shiplane <pr>` run follows it, or (c) the session tracks a PR, the last assistant message asks a question (not one it answers in the same paragraph, not a rhetorical "Why?"), and no open PR from this session has `needs-owner`. A hook continuation (`stop_hook_active`) always counts as the same turn. Plain: exits 1 with one reason line. `--hook`: reads the Stop hook payload (session id, `last_assistant_message` or the transcript) and prints `{"decision":"block","reason":...}`; at most 2 blocks per turn, each reason once per turn (a finished run's failure once per session), and any error lets the turn end. Does nothing outside a repo with `.agents/config.yml`. Codex loads project hooks (`.codex/hooks.json`) only once the project's `.codex/` layer is trusted, and runs a new hook only after you trust it (`/hooks`). |
| `shiplane upkeep [--dry-run]` | Daily, over the registered repos (macOS and Linux): fast-forwards each root checkout to origin/&lt;ship branch&gt;, removes worktrees whose PR is merged or closed, that are clean, whose every commit is in a pushed PR head, and that have been idle 2+ days (never `--force`), then runs doctor. |

The pre-push gate (`node .agents/shiplane/pre-push.mjs`, run by the hook) checks every pushed commit except tags and
deletes, `git push origin HEAD:branch` included: no changed file may flip CRLF/LF or become mixed; each `generated`
command must leave the tree unchanged; then `checkCommand` runs. In a fresh worktree without `node_modules` it says which install command to run.

## Settings (`.agents/config.yml`)

`shipTarget` (production | staging) · `branches: {production, staging}` · `needsOwner: {paths, categories}` ·
`checkCommand` · `installCommand` · `generated: [{run}]` · `deployWorkflows` · `liveUrl` · `mergeMethod`
(squash | merge | rebase) · `ciCheck` (the gate job's name, which the queue waits for) · `owners` (GitHub logins: assigned
`needs-owner` PRs and the red-live-branch issue) · `supersededSections` (AGENTS.md headings the shiplane block replaces;
`[]` keeps them all) · `workflowHeader` (extra comment lines kept at the top of shiplane-events.yml, e.g. a repo's required
`# Dry run:` and `# Revert:` lines; existing `# Dry run:`/`# Revert:` lines there are kept on re-render too).

## Events (`.github/workflows/shiplane-events.yml`)

Built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `permissions: {}` at the top and the least per job, `ubuntu-slim`, `timeout-minutes: 2`,
`actions/github-script` pinned by SHA and nothing else. The scripts read titles, bodies and branch names from the event
payload and only send them back through the API; config values reach them as quoted env values (a value containing
`${{` is refused).
- `pull_request_target` labeled `needs-owner`: assign `owners`, comment "Needs your decision: <first line of the body>"; `hold`: "On hold. Say ship to release it."
- `workflow_run` of each `deployWorkflows` file (matched by its `name:`) on the ship branch: "Deployed ✓ <sha> → <liveUrl>", "Not deployed: every deploy job was skipped…", or "Deploy failed: <run url>", on the PR of that commit.
- `workflow_run` of the CI workflow (the one with a job named `ciCheck`) failing on the ship branch: opens or updates one issue "Live branch is red" assigned to `owners`; closes it when the branch is green again. Only fires when that workflow runs on pushes to the ship branch.

## Zero-install hooks

- Claude Code: `.claude/settings.json`, `hooks.Stop`: `node "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}/.agents/shiplane/shiplane.mjs" guard --hook claude`, timeout 30 s.
- Codex: `.codex/hooks.json` (Codex supports project-level hooks; it merges them with `~/.codex/hooks.json` and loads them only when the project's `.codex/` is trusted): `node "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.agents/shiplane/shiplane.mjs" guard --hook codex`, timeout 30 s.
- Pre-push: lefthook and husky repos get it with their usual install. A `.githooks` repo needs `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` once per clone (git never takes it from the repo): the AGENTS block's first line says so, and `shiplane doctor` reports it.
- Owners without `gh needs-me`: `https://github.com/issues?q=is:open+org:<org>+label:needs-owner,hold` (PRs and issues) (in the AGENTS block with the repo's org).

## Skills

- `adopt`: after `shiplane init`, fit the CI gate (`templates/ci/gate.snippet.yml`) into the repo's existing workflow as its own PR, write its `checkCommand`, wire the gate into its hook manager, or propose `templates/ci/starter-pnpm.yml` / `starter-bun.yml` when it has no CI.
- `ship`: what to run when the user says ship, all, except #X, hold #X or now.

## From tug

A repo that ran `tug init` (1.1.0) is moved by `shiplane init`, in the same two PRs:
- init PR: `.agents/tug/` becomes `.agents/shiplane/` (the kit's files re-written, entry `shiplane.mjs`; any other file
  there is moved unchanged), `.agents/tug.lock` becomes `.agents/shiplane.lock`, the `<!-- tug:start -->` block in AGENTS.md
  is replaced in place by the shiplane block (never a second block), lefthook/husky/.githooks entries and the project
  hooks that call `.agents/tug/...` are pointed at `.agents/shiplane/`, and `.gitignore` exceptions follow
  (`!.agents/tug/` -> `!.agents/shiplane/`, `!.agents/tug.lock` -> `!.agents/shiplane.lock`). `.mergify.yml` written by tug
  is re-rendered as shiplane's.
- events PR: `.github/workflows/tug-events.yml` is renamed to `shiplane-events.yml` (workflow `shiplane events`), keeping its
  `# Dry run:`/`# Revert:` lines (with the file name updated); other files that name `tug-events.yml` (a CI budget list) are updated too.

Per machine, `shiplane setup` replaces user-level Stop hooks that run `tug.mjs guard` in `~/.claude/settings.json` and
`~/.codex/hooks.json` (merged in place, backup `*.shiplane-backup`) and moves `~/.config/tug/repos` into
`~/.config/shiplane/repos`. Until then `bin/tug.mjs` forwards to shiplane, so those hooks keep working, and upkeep still
reads tug's registry. The agent plugin is reinstalled by hand: `/plugin marketplace add klovr-co/shiplane`,
`/plugin install shiplane@shiplane`, `/plugin uninstall tug@tug` (Codex: `codex plugin add shiplane@shiplane`).
`shiplane doctor` lists whatever is left (`tug leftovers`).

## Development

    npm test    # node --test; tests that use git make their own repo under the OS temp dir; no network

shiplane replaces batchship (batch branches, `fix`/`ship`/`triage` scripts, BATCH.md, `.ship.json`, phrase-enforcing hooks),
retired on 22 Oct 2026 for the Mergify queue. That code is in this repo's history.
